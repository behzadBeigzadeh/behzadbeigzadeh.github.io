##### About

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Tarbiat Modares University. My research focuses on cutting-edge topics in cybersecurity, including SDN security, IoT security, federated learning security, and the application of machine learning to security.

##### Research

As a cybersecurity researcher at the [Tarbiat modares Computer Security Lab (TMU)](https://www.modares.ac.ir/), I specialize in cybersecurity, big data security, and machine learning-based detection systems. Currently, my research is centered on security audits in IoT and developing security metrics. I am also exploring innovative paradigms for creating the next generation of more secure systems.

##### Content Creating

I enjoy sharing my insights and knowledge on cybersecurity, through my friend's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@InfoSecTube).
