  abstract={The widespread deployment of sensors and linked items contributes to the rising interest in the Internet-of-Things (IoT). These are used in conjunction with other Online services to develop highly sophisticated and profitable cloud-based services. Despite significant attempts to secure them, security management remains a crucial problem for these devices, Because of their intricacy, heterogeneous nature, and resource constraints. This paper presents IoT-Shield, a data mining technique that coincides with a process mining approach for identifying misbehavior in of the kind. IoT-Shield enables the characterization of IoT devices' behavioral models and the detection of possible threats, even in the presence of diverse protocols and platforms. The underlying architecture and components are then described and formalized, and a proof-of-concept prototype is detailed. A real-world traffic dataset known as KDD-NSL is â€¦}

  abstract={Learning was always an essential part of our lives
to acquire knowledge and move forward. However, the
increasing wages of on-campus learning leads to an increasing
need for an alternate way of learning. With the outbreak of
COVID-19, people needed to stay at home for safety. Therefore,
finding an answer to this need became more dominant. Another
major problem, especially in the ongoing decade, is the lack of
enough cybersecurity knowledge by the common folk. This
paper aims to look at a new platform that is carefully designed
to teach cybersecurity to learners with any background. We
design this system using gamification to increase the efficiency
of learning. Because modern technologies are ubiquitous in our
lives, particularly during the coronavirus outbreak, including
practical work in teaching will be quite beneficial. The practical
activity has a clear advantage, such as promoting experimental
learning and improving student abilities and skills for the future
professional career. Finally, we assess this method with a classic
learning approach using two different groups.}

  abstract={One of the most promising applications of the IoT is the Smart Grid (SG). Integrating SG's data communications network into the power grid allows for gathering and analyzing information from power lines, distribution power stations, and end users. A smart grid (SG) requires a fast and dependable connection to provide real-time monitoring through the IoT. Hence 5G could be considered a catalyst for upgrading the existing power grid systems. Nonetheless, the additional attack surface of information infrastructure has been brought about by the widespread adoption of ubiquitous connectivity in 5G, to which the typical information security system in the smart grid cannot respond promptly. Therefore, guaranteeing the Privacy and Security of a network in a threatening, ever-changing environment requires groundbreaking architectures that go well beyond the limitations of traditional, static security measures. With" Continuous Identity Authentication and Dynamic Access Control" as its foundation, this article analyzes the Zero Trust (ZT) architecture specific to the power system of IoT and uses that knowledge to develop a security protection architecture.}

  abstract={The escalating complexity of cybersecurity threats necessitates innovative approaches to safeguard digital assets and sensitive information. The Zero Trust paradigm offers a transformative solution by challenging conventional security models and emphasizing continuous verification and least privilege access. This survey comprehensively explores the theoretical foundations, practical implementations, applications, challenges, and future trends of Zero Trust. Through meticulous analysis, we highlight the relevance of Zero Trust in securing cloud environments, facilitating remote work, and protecting the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. While cultural barriers and technical complexities present challenges, their mitigation unlocks Zero Trust's potential. Integrating Zero Trust with emerging technologies like AI and machine learning augments its efficacy, promising a dynamic and responsive security landscape. Embracing Zero Trust empowers organizations to navigate the ever-evolving cybersecurity realm with resilience and adaptability, redefining trust in the digital age.}

  abstract={Using dispersed data and training, federated learning (FL) moves AI capabilities to edge devices or does tasks locally. Many consider FL the start of a new era in AI, yet it is still immature. FL has not garnered the community's trust since its security and privacy implications are controversial. FL's security and privacy concerns must be discovered, analyzed, and recorded before widespread usage and adoption. A solid comprehension of risk variables allows an FL practitioner to construct a secure environment and provide researchers with a clear perspective of potential study fields, making FL the best solution in situations where security and privacy are primary issues. This research aims to deliver a complete overview of FL's security and privacy features to help bridge the gap between current federated AI and broad adoption in the future. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the attack surface to investigate FL's existing challenges and defense measures to evaluate its robustness and reliability. According to our study, security concerns regarding FL are more frequent than privacy issues. Communication bottlenecks, poisoning, and backdoor attacks represent FL's privacy's most significant security threats. In the final part, we detail future research that will assist FL in adapting to real-world settings.}
